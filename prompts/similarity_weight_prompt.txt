I have uploaded the details of 50 previously successful founders and 50 failed founders.  The founder's startus status is indicated in the column named "isSuccess", where a value of True means their startus is successful and False means otherwise.
Their profiles include also the following factors:
- Self Description
- Education Background
- Employment Background
- Long Description of their startup idea
- Category List
- Category Group List

Please evaluate the level of impact of each of the above factors to determining the founder's success or failure. Give a score between 0 to 10, for each of the factors, how well they explains the founder's success or failure.
Normalise the scores so that their sum adds to 10.
